  <div class="aboutthe">
  At Parsons School of Design, there is a coding course called the Core 1: Interaction. For one of the projects, "Rock Garden", we were supposed to create 20 “rocks” in the browser. Through design and coding, we will have a single page or multi-page website. When viewing the garden, we will have a narrative about your typology and draw the user in to what we found interesting about it.</div>

  <div class="paragraph">
For the project, I interviewed 20 staff members who are currently working at The New School. I took pictures of them with the mask and without the mask to show the hidden face behind the masks. We meet these staff members on a daily basis, however, we don’t know their names, their jobs, or what their favorite color is. This project will serve as an opportunity for the New School community to find out more about our staff members and truly see what’s hidden behind the mask.</div>
